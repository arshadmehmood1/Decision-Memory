AI Integration Architecture
Embedding Generation:
// When decision created/updated
async function generateEmbedding(decision: Decision) {
  const text = `${decision.title} ${decision.context} ${decision.theDecision}`;
  
  const response = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: "text-embedding-3-small",
    input: text,
  });
  
  const embedding = response.data[0].embedding;
  
  // Store embedding as JSON string in DB
  await prisma.decision.update({
    where: { id: decision.id },
    data: { embedding: JSON.stringify(embedding) }
  });
}
Similar Decision Search:
// Using pgvector extension in Postgres
async function findSimilarDecisions(decisionId: string, limit = 3) {
  const decision = await prisma.decision.findUnique({
    where: { id: decisionId },
    select: { embedding: true }
  });
  
  if (!decision?.embedding) return [];
  
  // Raw SQL query using pgvector cosine similarity
  const similar = await prisma.$queryRaw`
    SELECT id, title, status, "madeOn"
    FROM "Decision"
    WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL
      AND id != ${decisionId}
      AND "workspaceId" = (SELECT "workspaceId" FROM "Decision" WHERE id = ${decisionId})
    ORDER BY embedding <=> ${decision.embedding}::vector
    LIMIT ${limit}
  `;
  
  return similar;
}
AI Tagging:
async function generateTags(decision: Decision) {
  const prompt = `Analyze this decision and generate 3-5 relevant tags (single words or 2-word phrases):

Title: ${decision.title}
Context: ${decision.context}
Decision: ${decision.theDecision}

Generate tags that capture: topic, domain, strategy type.
Output as JSON array: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0.3,
  });
  
  const tags = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content || "[]");
  return tags.slice(0, 5); // Max 5 tags
}
Insight Generation (Phase 4):
// Background job runs weekly
async function generateInsights(workspaceId: string) {
  const decisions = await prisma.decision.findMany({
    where: { workspaceId },
    include: { assumptions: true, review: true }
  });
  
  if (decisions.length < 20) return; // Need min 20 decisions
  
  // Calculate stats
  const stats = {
    total: decisions.length,
    succeeded: decisions.filter(d => d.status === 'SUCCEEDED').length,

    reversed: decisions.filter(d => d.status === 'REVERSED').length,
    byCategory: groupBy(decisions, 'category'),
    assumptionAccuracy: calculateAssumptionAccuracy(decisions),
  };
  
  // Use GPT to generate insights
  const prompt = `Analyze these decision patterns and generate 3-5 actionable insights:

Statistics:
${JSON.stringify(stats, null, 2)}

Sample failed decisions:
${decisions.filter(d => d.status === 'FAILED').slice(0, 5).map(d => ({
  title: d.title,
  category: d.category,
  review: d.review?.whatWentWrong
}))}

Generate insights in format:
{
  "insights": [
    {
      "type": "RECURRING_FAILURE" | "ASSUMPTION_BLINDSPOT" | "CATEGORY_TREND",
      "title": "Short title",
      "description": "Detailed insight with evidence and suggestion"
    }
  ]
}`;

  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    response_format: { type: "json_object" },
  });
  
  const { insights } = JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
  
  // Store insights in DB
  for (const insight of insights) {
    await prisma.insight.create({
      data: {
        workspaceId,
        insightType: insight.type,
        title: insight.title,
        description: insight.description,
        relatedDecisions: [], // Could be enhanced to link specific decisions

  }
}

Scalability Plan
MVP Scale Target: 500 users, 10k decisions, 1k API requests/hour
Bottlenecks & Solutions:
Phase-by-Phase Scaling:
Phase 1-2 (0-100 users):
- Vercel Hobby plan
- Supabase Free tier
- OpenAI $50/month budget
- No caching needed

Phase 3-4 (100-500 users):
- Vercel Pro plan ($20/month)
- Supabase Pro ($25/month)
- OpenAI $200/month budget
- Add Redis caching (Upstash, $10/month)

Phase 5+ (500-2000 users):
- Vercel Team plan or migrate to Railway/Fly.io
- Supabase Team ($599/month) or self-hosted Postgres
- OpenAI $500/month budget or switch to cheaper embedding model
- Dedicated Redis instance
- Consider CDN for static assets

Security & Data Privacy
Authentication:
Clerk handles auth (OAuth, email/password)
JWTs for API authentication
Session management via Clerk
Authorization:
Row-level security via Prisma middleware
Users can only access decisions in their workspace
Role-based access control (Admin, Member, Viewer)
Data Encryption:
At-rest: Postgres encryption (Supabase default)
In-transit: HTTPS/TLS everywhere (Vercel default)
Sensitive fields (budget_impact) encrypted at app level (Phase 5+)
API Rate Limiting:
// Using Upstash Redis
import { Ratelimit } from "@upstash/ratelimit";

const ratelimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(100, "1 h"), // 100 requests per hour
});

export async function rateLimit(userId: string) {
  const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(userId);
  if (!success) throw new Error("Rate limit exceeded");
}
GDPR Compliance:
User can delete account → cascades delete all data
Data export available (Phase 3)
Privacy policy and terms of service (launch requirement)
Cookie consent banner (if using analytics)
AI Data Handling:
OpenAI API: Only send decision text (no PII like emails, user names)
Anonymize data before sending to AI
No training on user data (OpenAI default for API usage)

Step 2: Welcome Modal
Full-screen modal (cannot skip):

"Welcome to Decision Memory! 👋

Let's get you started in 3 quick steps."

[Next]

Step 3: Onboarding Tour
Screen 1: "What is a decision?"

"A decision is any choice that:
- Affects your business
- You might regret later
- You want to learn from

Examples:
✓ Switching from Heroku to Railway
✓ Hiring a senior engineer
✓ Changing pricing from $49 to $99"

[Next]

---

Screen 2: "How Decision Memory works"

"1. Log decisions as you make them
2. Update outcomes later
3. AI finds patterns to help you improve

[Show interactive demo]"

[Next]

---

Screen 3: "Your first decision"

"Let's log your first decision together.

Choose:
○ Use a demo decision (we'll pre-fill everything)
○ Log a real decision from the past week
○ I'll explore on my own"

[Continue]

Step 4A: If User Selects "Demo Decision"
Pre-filled decision shown:

Title: "Switch from Heroku to Railway"
Category: Tech
Status: Active

Context: "Heroku's pricing increased 40%. Our monthly bill hit $400. We need a cheaper alternative that still offers good DX."

The Decision: "We're migrating all services to Railway. Migration to be completed in 2 weeks."

Alternatives Considered:
1. Stay on Heroku → Too expensive at scale
2. Self-host on AWS → Too much ops overhead for 2-person team
3. Railway → Best balance of cost ($50/month) and DX

Key Assumptions:
1. Migration will take <2 weeks
2. Railway has comparable uptime to Heroku
3. No hidden costs or gotchas

Success Criteria:
1. All services running on Railway
2. Monthly bill <$100
3. Zero downtime during migration

[Annotations shown]:
"👆 This is the context - WHY you're making this decision"
"👆 These are alternatives you considered but rejected"
"👆 These assumptions will be validated later"

[This is a demo - Create Your Own]
User clicks "Create Your Own" → Goes to blank decision form

Step 4B: If User Selects "Log a Real Decision"
Simplified form (only required fields):

"Tell us about a decision you made recently"

Decision Title:
[___________________________________________]
Placeholder: "e.g., Hired a freelance designer"

What did you decide?
[___________________________________________]
Placeholder: "In 1-2 sentences, what did you choose?"

Category:
[Dropdown: Product, Marketing, Sales, Hiring, Tech, Operations, Strategic, Other]

[Save Decision] [Cancel]

After saving:
"🎉 You logged your first decision!

Want to add more details?
- Why you made this decision
- What alternatives you considered
- What assumptions you're making

[Add Details] [I'll do this later]"

Step 5: Dashboard First Load
